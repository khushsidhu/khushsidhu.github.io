# [Project A Proposal]({% post_url 2019-01-11-week1 %})

I would like to design titles and bring them to life. I came up with a lot of tools and softwares which could be helpful in achieving this. After researching more about this I concluded that Adobe After Effects would be best to work on as it is one of the most widely software tool used for creating animation and motion graphics. Being a designer, I realized that typography makes the work feel more professional. My project would include animating the text, various text effects and motion graphics. I would be probably creating a video project of about 10 seconds showing few animated titles using different effects.
