[Week-2]({% post_url 2019-01-18-week2 %})

As I am going to create animated titles for my project, this week I learned how to use different tools of After Effects. I worked on selecting different font families and styles for my final project. I also looked for few videos that I would use as background for the titles. Then I researched about animating the text and looked at a number of tutorials. It took me some time to get my hands on the tools of this software as it is completely new for me. I also animated the text using a line or shapes. I also tried using masking technique on the titles. 
Next week I would be researching more about other techniques and effects used to animate the text and use them for creating the titles along with a video.
