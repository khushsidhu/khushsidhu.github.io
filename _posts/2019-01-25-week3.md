#[Week-3]({% post_url 2019-01-25-week3 %})

This week I created two animations, one for the text and the other one for the background. For animating the text I tried many effects and finally made a small animation by using masks around the text. For the background animation, I used CC Particle World, Glow and Gradient Ramp effects. I am still deciding that which effects I would be using for my final prototype.
Next week I would try various other animation effects for text and background and start with my prototype with the decided effects.
