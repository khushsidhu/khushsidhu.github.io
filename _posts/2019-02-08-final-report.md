# [Final Report]({% post_url 2019-02-08-final-report %})

## Things I Did This Week
- This week I made all the remaining titles for the project. 
- After that I combined them in a separate composition and rendered the video in Media Encoder. 
- Along with this, I completed the tutorial with the required screenshots.

## Evaluation
- I was able to complete my project on time and the scope was met. 
- As I decided earlier, I made a video project of about 30 seconds which shows the titles over photos and videos. 
- Although I had some problem with the keyframes, yet I figured it out by following some tutorials and finished my project within time.

## Lessons Learned
- Understanding of tools and techniques of Adobe After Effects.
- Learned how to create effective and attractive titles for photos and videos.
- Was able to create a tutorial for a novice showing title animation.

## Unexpected Challenges
- Earlier I faced some difficulty working with the keyframes but later learned how to set them up by getting help from the tutorials.
