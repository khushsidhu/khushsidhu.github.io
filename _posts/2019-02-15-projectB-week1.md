# [Project B Proposal]({% post_url 2019-02-15-projectB-week1 %})

For Project B I would like to present a prototype or mockup for a website designed using Figma. 

I chose Figma as a design tool as Figma is one of the most popular browser-based design tool used for numerous purposes like designing user interfaces and prototyping. Figma provides a number of features such as vector tools, components similar to symbols, drawing tools, editing options and many more. I have not decided the theme of the prototype yet, I would do so in the upcoming week.

I decided to work on prototyping using Figma as prototypes are something which quickly grab the attention of the client and also guide the development team in every project.
