# [Week-2]({% post_url 2019-03-01-projectB-week2 %})

## Accomplishments
As I am going to design the prototypes using Figma, this week I decided that the prototypes would be that of an online magazine. I would particularly focus on the prototypes for the mobile version. I also got my hands on this software and learned how to use various tools of Figma as this is my first time I am working with it. I also created designs of the website on paper.

## Problems
I have not faced much difficulty until now because I have just researched about various tools of Figma and started with the designing of the prototypes.

## Plan for next week
Next week I will start creating the designs using Figma.
