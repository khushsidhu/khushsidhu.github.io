# [Week-2]({% post_url 2019-03-01-projectB-week2 %})

## Accomplishments
As I am going to design the prototypes using Figma, this week I decided that the prototypes would be that of an online magazine. Last week I decided to create a website but as I explored more about Figma, I changed my mind and decided that I would particularly focus on the mobile application for the magazine. I also got my hands on this software and learned how to use various tools of Figma as this is my first time I am working with it. I also created the wireframes and mockups of the application on paper.

## Problems
I have not faced much difficulty until now because I have just researched about various tools of Figma and started with the designing of the prototypes.

## Plan for next week
Next week I will start creating the designs using Figma. I would create splash screen, login and sign up screen, home and try to continue designing other pages of the application.
