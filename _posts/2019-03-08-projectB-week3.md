# [Week-3]({% post_url 2019-03-08-projectB-week3 %})

## Accomplishments
This week I designed a logo for the magazine which would be used for the mobile application. I also felt that the wireframes  made on paper needed some improvements so I did that too. I chose the color palette and fonts for the application. Then I designed splash screen, login, sign up screen and started with the homepage using Figma.  

## Problems
I faced some difficulty in using the scale tool because Figma doesn't allow us to manually enter the numeric values while scaling the components.

## Plan for next week
Next week I am planning to complete the homepage, and start designing other pages of the magazine such as categories and article pages. I would refer more tutorials and explore other tools of Figma.
