# [Week-3]({% post_url 2019-03-08-projectB-week3 %})

## Accomplishments
This week I designed a logo for the magazine which would be used for the mobile application. I also felt that the wireframes  made on paper needed some improvements so I did that too. I also designed splash screen, login, sign up screen and homepage using Figma.
