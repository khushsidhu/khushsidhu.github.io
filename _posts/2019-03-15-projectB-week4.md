# [Week-4]({% post_url 2019-03-15-projectB-week4 %})

## Accomplishments
This week I finished designing the homepage and also desgined other pages such as Favourite, Following, Search, Profile pages and Menus. I explored various tools of Figma including Components and Boolean Groups while designing these prototypes.

## Problems
I did not face any major difficulty as I have been quite familiar with Figma till now. Moreover, I followed numerous tutorials which helped me in clearing my doubts about the tools of Figma.

## Plan for next week
I am planning to complete the designs next week and start with the prototyping. I would follow more tutorials as prototyping with a software would be something new for me.
