# [Week-5]({% post_url 2019-03-22-projectB-week5 %})

## Accomplishments
This week I made a little bit of changes in the designs of my application. Along with the designing part, I linked all the frames of the project and completed the prototyping. I followed many tutorials for the purpose of prototyping as this was something completely new for me.

## Problems
Although I faced some difficulty in creating the prototype of the overlay menu of the website, few tutorials helped me out in clearing my doubts and I was able to complete the prototypes.

## Plan for next week
Next week I will make my final presentation of the application and prepare for the same. Moreover, if I feel the prototype needs any improvement, I will also make changes in it. I will complete my whole project by next week.
