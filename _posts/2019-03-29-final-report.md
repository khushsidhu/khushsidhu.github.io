# [Final Report]({% post_url 2019-03-29-final-report %})

## Things I Did This Week
This week I made few improvements to the design and prototypes of the magazine application. 
Moreover, I prepared the presentation for the project.

## Evaluation
Fortunately, I completed my project on time and met its scope. 
Earlier I decided that I would design a website but later on as I explored the tools of Figma, I decided to work on a mobile application for an online magazine.
I used various tools of Figma such as components, constraints and many prototyping options.
Although I found setting up the overlay menus a bit challenging, yet I figured it out by following a tutorial and completed my prototype on time.

## Lessons Learned
I got understanding of the tools of a new designing tool- Figma. 
I learned how to design the interface of a mobile application and how to create interactive flows that tells how a user can interact with those designs. 
I learned how to create an effective presentation about tool and prototype which are new to the listeners.

## Unexpected Challenges
In the beginning of my project, I faced some difficulty in getting used to the tools of Figma such as working with components and creating overlay menu. But tutorials on these helped a lot and I was able to effectively use them in my project.

## Future Work
After completing my project, I concluded that Figma can be very useful for me in my future. I can use Figma for designing the interface of any website or mobile application.
Figma can also be used for prototyping in a project by creating flows between the designs.
